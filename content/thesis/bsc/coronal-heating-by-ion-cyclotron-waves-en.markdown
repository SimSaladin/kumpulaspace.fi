# Coronal heating by ion-cyclotron waves

**start:** any time
<br>**supervision:** Dr. Rami Vainio, University of Helsinki

The heating of the solar corona to multi-million degree temperatures is one of
the major open questions of solar physics. In open magnetic field regions, one
of the proposed mechanisms is heating by damping of ion-cyclotron waves. The aim
of this work is to review the recent literature concerning the principles and
the details of the different variants of this heating model and the
observational support (and possible of lack of it) for this model.
