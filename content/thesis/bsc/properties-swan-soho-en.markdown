The SWAN instrument on  board the ESA-NASA  solar observatory SOHO has measured
interplanetary Lyman alpha since 1995. These measurements can be used to study
the solar wind distribution and the properties of the local interstellar cloud
(LIC) surrounding the heliosphere. In this MSc thesis the velocity vector and
temperature of LIC are determined by fitting a model to SWAN measurements.
