The European Cluster Assimilation Technology (ECLAT) programme will
provide an unparalleled space plasma physics data repository and
software tools archive for the Solar Terrestrial Physics community,
building on the existing European Space Agency's Cluster Active Archive
initiative. The Earth's magnetosphere is the best observed space plasma
environment in the universe, providing a wealth of information on
fundamental plasma phenomena, planetary magnetospheric structure and
behaviour, the environmental impact of the Sun-Earth connection, and the
operational environment for space-based technology.

 However, the sheer volume of data available, the wide variety of
observational methods and measurement types in situ measurements,
remote-sensing observations, modelling results, on micro-, meso-, and
global scales means that fully exploiting this incredible resource is
extremely difficult.

 The objective of this proposal is to upgrade an already-existing
European Space Physics Data Centre, the ESA Cluster Active Archive
(CAA), increase its data holdings with a wide selection of additional
data and to develop software tools to facilitate data-mining and
data-visualization, to provide a research resource to the space plasma
community that does not currently exist. One of the key aims of the
proposal is to extend existing European magnetospheric modelling
activities for inclusion in the CAA, with the ultimate aspiration being
to develop 'reanalysis' and assimilation technology to marry model
output with observations to provide a holistic, synoptic 3D time-history
of magnetospheric state, which will provide a contextual framework for
interpretation of all other magnetospheric data-sets.
