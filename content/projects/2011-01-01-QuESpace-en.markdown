The project aims to quantify energy circulation in space plasmas using
large-scale models, local measurements and developing a new
self-consistent space weather simulation. Technologically, understanding
the plasma and energy transport is a step toward predictions of the
space environment. The present models cannot accurately and
self-consistently describe the near-Earth space in particular in the
inner magnetosphere, where major magnetic storms can cause serious
damage to space-borne technology. The project has three goals:

 1. Novel integration of observations from ESA's Cluster mission with
simulation results to gain quantitative understanding of global energy
circulation;
 2. Development of a new self-consistent global plasma simulation that
describes multi-component and multi-temperature plasmas;
 3. To enhance the FMI's present models so that they can be used in
operational space weather purposes. The achievements need benchmarking
against items 1 and 2.
