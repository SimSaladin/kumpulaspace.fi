The Sun is both a source off all life and significant hazards. Solar
energetic particle (SEP) events provoke extreme space weather, putting
the functioning of satellites at risk. The SEPServer project will
combine fragmented data to better understanding such events.

 Throughout the world, scientist strive to understand the sometimes
extreme behavior of our nearest star - the Sun. With 2012 and the high
of the solar cycle approaching, the number of solar energetic particle
(SEP) events is set to increase, provoking more extreme weather
conditions. Whilst no noticeable by humans on Earth, space weather is a
hazard for satellites, for the astronauts on-board the International
Space Station (ISS), and in extreme cases for the aircrew on polar
flight. Therefore, scientists observe SEP events. However, short of a
coordinated approach and fully open access to SEP data, the value of
this immense work is less than optimal.

 SEPServer addresses this shortfall; the project aims at adding value to
several existing space missions and Earth based observations by
facilitating such coordination by promoting open access to data. In
doing so, it will produce a new tool that will greatly facilitate the
investigation of SEPs and their origin. This tool is to take the form as
a server that provides SEP data, related electromagnetic (EM)
observations and analysis methods, a comprehensive catalogue of
observing SEP events, as well as educational outreach material on solar
eruptions.

 Hence SEPServer integrates scattered data from a number of
international sources, enhancing data accessibility, and thereby
contributing to better quality evaluation, whist fertilizing the ground
for new data analysis and modelling to be performed to better understand
the Sun and the space weather that it creates.
