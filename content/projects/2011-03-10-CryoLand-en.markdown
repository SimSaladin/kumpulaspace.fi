The project is aimed at developing, implementing and validating a standardized
and sustainable service on snow and land ice monitoring as a Downstream Service
within GMES in a value added chain with the Land Monitoring Core Services.
CryoLand will provide geospatial products on snow cover, glaciers, and
lake/river ice derived from Earth observation satellite data. CryoLand will
build upon, integrate and widen structural and technical capabilities of the
project partners who have long term experience in running operational and
pre-operational services on snow and ice. Users will play a key role in the
definition of service requirements and in the validation of the products and
services. A user group will be set up, and user training on use of products and
electronic interfaces will be performed. Snow and ice products in near-real time
delivery will be supplied with pan-European coverage, as well as with national
and regional coverage.

The project developments will build upon tools and processing lines that are
available at partner's enterprises. The portfolio of snow and ice products will
be improved and augmented to better match the user requirements. An important
part of the project will be the design, development and implementation of a
network system for CryoLand services that will ensure interoperability of
infrastructure by compliance with INSPIRE and GEOSS, and by integration with the
Land Monitoring Core Services, the GMES Space Component Data Access service, and
the required in-situ and reference data access. Full end-to-end tests and
verification will be performed for the products and services in pre-operational
environment, based on rigorous procedures and protocols for testing, validation
and qualification. During the project second phase full performance
demonstration of the system and comprehensive promotion and dissemination work
is planned in order to prepare for the transition to a self-sustained
operational snow and land ice monitoring service.
